Fire Weather Index Predictor (FWI)
The Fire Weather Index Predictor is a machine learning-based web application that predicts the Fire Weather Index (FWI) based on various environmental factors. The application uses a Ridge Regression model and a Standard Scaler to preprocess the input data and generate predictions.

This project is built using Flask for the backend and is deployed on GitHub for version control.

Features
